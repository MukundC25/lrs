# Smart Lifestyle & Learning Recommender System
## Project Report

**Project Title:** Smart Lifestyle & Learning Recommender  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Track:** AI/ML Development  

---

## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, individuals struggle to make optimal lifestyle and learning choices that align with their current mood, available time, and personal interests. Traditional recommendation systems often fail to consider the dynamic nature of human emotions and time constraints, leading to generic suggestions that don't resonate with users' immediate needs.

The core problems addressed by this system include:
- **Mood-Context Disconnect**: Existing platforms don't factor in users' emotional states when making recommendations
- **Time Constraint Ignorance**: Most systems don't optimize suggestions based on available time slots
- **Interest Fragmentation**: Separate platforms for fitness, nutrition, and learning create a fragmented user experience
- **Lack of Personalization**: Generic recommendations that don't adapt to user feedback and preferences
